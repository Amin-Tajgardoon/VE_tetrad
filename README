This is the code for the Tetrad Project; an introduction
can be found here:

www.phil.cmu.edu/tetrad

This is a Maven port of an existing Ant-based project
that's been under development for many years in the
Department of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon University.

To set this project up in IntelliJ IDEA, fork it, clone
it to your desktop, download IntelliJ IDEA CE (free),
select File->New Project from Existing Sources), and
click OK repeatedly until the project is set up.

If you'd like to launch the GUI in IntelliJ IDEA, 
from the dropdown at the top select "Edit Configurations"
-->Plus-->Application, call it "Tetrad" and select the 
Tetrad class using the ... field. Then click OK and 
click the green arrow. Alternatively, you can run the 
lifecycle package target and launch the ejar that is 
built in the target directory, using the call

java -jar *-ejar.jar

The project contains fairly well-developed code in these 
packages:

tetrad
tetradapp

The tetrad package contains the "model" code; the tetradapp
package contains the "view" (GUI) code.

Contributions are welcome; we will handle these via the 
GitHub pull-request procedure. As usual, please fork the
repository if you'd like to work on it. Comments are also
welcome.

We will try to straighten out our websites soon. Sorry.

More detail will be added in time.
