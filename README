By default, we will assume that this project is being
set up in IntelliJ IDEA CE. To get IntelliJ IDEA CE, Google
it. It's free and open source. Alternatively, you can
use Maven commands at the command line. If there are other
options that work, please let us know.

The file structure is set up so that if you open the
project directory in IntelliJ IDEA, it will load right
up. The Maven tab on the right will contain the lifecycle
targets, which you can run by double clicking.

The project contains fairly well-developed code in these 
packages:

tetrad
tetradapp

The tetrad package contains the "model" code; the tetradapp
package contains the "view" (GUI) code. If you'd like to
launch the GUI in IntelliJ IDEA, from the dropdown at the
top select "Edit Configurations"-->Plus-->Application, call
it "Tetrad" and select the Tetrad class usign the ... field.
Then click OK and click the green arrow.

Contributions are welcome; we will handle these via the 
GitHub pull-request procedure. As usual, please fork the
repository if you'd like to work on it. Comments are also
welcome.

We will try to straighten out our websites soon. Sorry.

More detail will be added in time.
