This is the code for the Tetrad Project; an introduction
can be found here:

www.phil.cmu.edu/tetrad

This is a Maven port of an existing Ant-based project
that's been under development for many years in the
Department of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon University.

For instructions on how to set this project up in 
IntelliJ IDEA, see the Wiki. Alternatively, you can 
run the lifecycle package target and launch the ejar 
that is  built in the target directory, using the call

java -jar *-launch.jar

The project contains fairly well-developed code in these 
packages:

tetrad
tetradapp

The tetrad package contains the "model" code; the tetradapp
package contains the "view" (GUI) code.

Contributions are welcome; we will handle these via the
issue tracker and the GitHub pull-request procedure. As 
usual, please fork the repository if you'd like to work on 
it. Comments are also welcome.

We will try to straighten out our websites soon. Sorry.

Still in the process of cleaning up the code for general use,
sorry. Some files may be removed in the process.

IntelliJ IDEA files were removed from the repository; if
these got removed in your fork, just set up the IntelliJ
project again (without cloning it again, that is). See
Wiki.
